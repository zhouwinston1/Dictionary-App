# dictionary_app
This app is designed to assist AP Language & Composition students in memorizing vocabulary for their AP Exam. Through a dynamic mobile app, it fetches JSON data from a public dictionary API, providing users with definitions, origins, synonyms, and more. Words searched by the user are stored in real-time in Firebase, creating a personalized word list that can be accessed anytime for quick reference and review.
